# Cech_Computations

Magma code for computations on certain Real Lagrangians in
Quintic threefolds, as described by Hülya Argüz and Thomas Prince,
these originally appeared in the arXiv preprint

https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10172

These results have been generalised by the results of 

https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06685.

Moreover, various further computations pertaining to
real Lagrangian in Calabi-Yau threefolds appear in 

https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03957

The accompanying Magma scripts allow the computation of the Cech cohomology
of the real Lagrangian in the mirror-quintic threefold, using the procedure described in 
https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06685, together with the tropical cycle computation
described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10172.

Magma can obtained from the Computational Algebra Group at the University of Sydney, Australia; see

http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/

To use the scripts, ensure that your working directory contains the
scripts, start Magma, and enter:

1) load "acyclic_cover_computation.m";

See 'Expected_output.txt' for details of the output.
