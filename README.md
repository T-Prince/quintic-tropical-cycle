# Cech_Computations
Magma code for computations considered in the paper:
"On Real Lagrangians in Quintic Threefolds" by  
H端lya Arg端z, and Thomas Prince, 2018.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10172

The accompanying Magma scripts allow the computation of the Cech
complexes described in the article "On Real Lagrangians in Quintic Threefolds" by  
H端lya Arg端z, and Thomas Prince, 2018. These compute cohomology groups of a
real Lagrangian L_R, which form the subject of that paper. The algorithms
used are described in the paper, and in the references therein.

Magma can obtained from the Computational Algebra Group at the University of Sydney, Australia; see

http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/

To use the scripts, ensure that your working directory contains the
scripts, start Magma, and enter:

1) load "acyclic_cover_computation.m";

See 'Expected_output.txt' for details of the output.

2) load "coarse_cover_computation.m";

See 'Expected_output.txt' for details of the output.
